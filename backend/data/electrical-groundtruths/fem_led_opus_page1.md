## FEATURES & SPECIFICATIONS

**INTENDED USE** — A general purpose and energy-efficient surface-mounted or suspended LED fixture, suitable for wet, damp and/or cold locations. For vapor-tight demanding environments where moisture or dust is a concern and where relatively low fixture mounting heights and wide fixture spacing are common. Not for use or installation in direct outdoor sunlight. Must be installed under canopy or covered ceiling. For direct sunlight installations, please refer to the FEX product family. Typical applications include industrial facilities, parking garages, retail malls, multi-purpose rooms, garden centers, and food processing. **Certain airborne contaminants can diminish the integrity of acrylic and/or polycarbonate. Click here for Acrylic/Polycarbonate Compatibility table for suitable use.**

Certain airborne contaminants may adversely affect the functioning of LEDs and other electronic components, depending on various factors such as concentrations of the contaminants, ventilation, and temperature at the end-user location. **Click here for a list of substances that may not be suitable for interaction with LEDs and other electronic components.**

**CONSTRUCTION** — One-piece 5VA fiberglass housing with integral perimeter channel utilizing continuous poured-in-place NEMA 4X gasket. Approved for through wiring. Captive polymeric latches are standard. Stainless steel latches (316SS) available as an option for food processing or more demanding applications. Power connection is easily accomplished through pre-drilled holes.

**OPTICS** — Injection molded, acrylic lens (.080" thick) provides high impact-resistance comparable to 100% DR. A UV stabilized polycarbonate diffuser is available (.080" thick) in clear or frosted for additional impact strength where vandal protection is desired.

Expected service life of 60,000 hours at 80% lumen maintenance (L80); predicted life of more than 100,000 hours.

**ELECTRICAL** — Utilizes high-efficiency LEDs mounted to core circuit boards. High-efficiency drivers operate 120-277 (MVOLT) and 347-480 (HVOLT) offered with 0-10 volt dimming, dims to 10%. Standard Luminaire Surge Protection Level: 6kV/3kA Surge Rated per ANSI C82.77-5-2015.

**INSTALLATION** — A pair of stainless steel (316SS) surface mount brackets (SMB) are included (unless another mounting option is chosen) allowing for surface (ceiling) or suspension mount applications using included bail with aircraft cable or chain. Optional pair of dual pendant mount brackets (DPMB) (316SS) are available for surface (ceiling) or suspension mount applications using either 3/8" threaded rod or included bail with aircraft cable or chain. Optional pair of angle mounting brackets (ANGBKT) (316SS) for horizontal wall mount applications.

**LISTINGS** — CSA Certified to UL and C-UL Standards. Suitable for wet location. IP65, IP66, IP67 and IP69K (optional) rated. NSF Splash Zone 2 and Non-Food Zone rated. NEMA Type 4X rated. Sensors maintain IP65 and IP66 only. See chart on page 5 for Ambient Temperatures.
